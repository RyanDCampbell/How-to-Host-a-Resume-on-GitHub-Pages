## Purpose

## Instructions

###  Installing Software

There are a few programs that you will need to have installed before we can host your resume on GitHub Pages. Namely, RubyInstaller, Atom, and Jekyll.  Ruby is required by Jekyll as a Prerequisite.  Atom is the Markdown editor we will be using for this guide. Lastly, Jekyll turns our Markdown formatted document and converts in into a static website that we will host on GitHub Pages.

  1. Download and install [Ruby+Devkit](https://rubyinstaller.org/). The default installation settings will install everything you need, except the last step of the installation run the following command:


    ridk install


  2. Download and install [Atom](https://atom.io/). The default installation settings will suffice.

  3. To install Jekyll, open a command prompt window and run the following command:


    gem install jekyll bundler
